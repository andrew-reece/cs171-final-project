<span class="header">About this Site</span>
<p>We were intrigued by the <a href="http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/">Reality Commons Project</a> produced by the  <a href="http://hd.media.mit.edu/">MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory</a>, particularly the Social Evolution dataset.  That research was published as:</p>

<p>
    We liked this project and dataset because, although information on social interactions is traditionally collected through surveys, the Reality Commons project used hard data collected from cell phones, Bluetooth devices, and WiFi access points to track the participants' interactions.  This was supplemented with survey data to give a fuller picture of the participants.  Thanks to the MIT Human Dynamics Lab, we had access to data about the participants' proximities to each other, phone calls and text messages to each other, and their survey results about preferences regarding politics, music, eating habits, exercise habits, campus activities, and other topics.

    The data was available in a suite of comma-delimited files, which we manipulated via python scripts to create data structures we could use in our visualizations (for example, the chord diagram requires a square matrix).  We used javascript and d3.js to create the force-directed graph, chord diagram, and heatmaps displayed on this site.  (For details on how to use the site, see the User Guide tab).

<span class="byline"><p>Preliminary Assessment of the Data</p>
    <p>[jennifer mar 25]</p></span>
    <p>We viewed the CSV data using spreadsheets and reviewed the papers and visualizations on the Reality Commons website before deciding that the most fruitful data were probably the proximity and communication (call/SMS) data, and that we would supplement it with the participants' musical taste and political opinions.  The latter two items were less likely to change over time and could be seen as "attributes" of each person, while we examine the participants' changing relationships with each other by way of the changing frequency of communications between them over time.</p>

    <p>[andrew apr 10]</p></span>
<p>
Data wrangling has been a big part of this first stage of our project.  On the one hand, the SE dataset is, as datasets go, beautiful.  It's complete, well-organized, and pretty well documented.  So we were able to avoid issues that often come with uneven or incomplete datasets, such as sparsity and imputation.  On the other hand, our design implementations address the data in specific ways which the original structures weren't always well-equipped to serve.</p>

<p>For instance, the chord layout requires a square matrix to render pairwise edges.  That sort of wrangling can be done online, in the javascript that loads as part of our visualization.  Other restructuring required more heavy-duty wrangling, which we carried out using Python's Pandas module. In particular, generating periodicity and aggregate measures out of time series data took some figuring out. </p>
