<span class="header">Network Details for chord</span>
<span class="byline">[brian apr 26]</span>

<p>I am working on getting Network Details to work for the chord graph, 
similar to how it works for the force directed graph.  </p>

<p>Inside of chord, when you mouseover a path, 
it only provides you source/target index values.  
These are indexes within a construct the chord layout builds layout.chords().  
I wrote a function that will build a unique pair key, 
always returning a unique key for any set of users, called getPairName().  
It returns a value like user24-user53.  I then have a copy of chData which is 
chDataByPair, that is indexed by this format of key.  This allows me to get the 
pairName, and then use the pairName to index chDataByPair to get the proper object 
to pass to setNetworkDetails.  Some of this may seem redundant, but I can clean much 
of it up to use the more rich data structures and get rid of the ones that donâ€™t 
have as much data. </p> 

<p>Here is an example of mousing over the path between user24 and user58:</p>
