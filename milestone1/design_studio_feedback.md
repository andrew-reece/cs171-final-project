<i>Andrew represented our team in class for Design Studio 3.  He met with another student, Yingyi Wang, whose team was also composed of distance-learning students (besides himself).</i>

Yingyi generally had positive feedback about our work thus far.  He had two main comments about our design implementation.  
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Yingyi felt the chord diagram was visually appealing but conveyed information to him less effectively than the force-directed layout did.  
<br />
	Our response: We are still deciding on the ways that these two network visualizations (chord and force) will interact with each other.  We agree that each have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and it was encouraging to hear similar impressions from other people aside from our own team.  We'll definitely take this into account when choosing the kind of visual experience that best allows users to understand what the data has to say.
<br />
<li>Yingyi pointed out that the two types of time series data we have - communication and proximity frequency - may each have their own stories to tell, regarding the social networks formed by subjects in this experiment.  As such, he suggested that the force-directed layout might be able to capture the evolution of both variables over time, by using spatial clustering of nodes as an indicator of proximity data, and edge weights as a measure of communication frequency between pairs of nodes.  
<br />
	Our response: It's a cool idea.  We're not sure how easy it is to implement spatial clustering over time series data, but we're looking into it.  If we can get it working, we agree that it might provide interesting bivariate information for the social networks in this dataset.

Yingyi didn't have any other feedback, other than he thought that our project was a good one.  Thanks to Yingyi!
